# Solidity Tutorial

## Setup

### Setup up local file access for remix

#### 2018-11-27

- Stopped using local file sharing due to _constant_ prompting for the IDE
  saying the file on the local host had changed and would I like to reload it.

#### Instructions

The install instructions below were take from
[Access your local filesystem by using remixd](https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_remixd_filesystem.html)
article.

- `npm install remixd --save-dev` installs remix demon for sharing local files
- `npm run remix` npm script to start the remix demon
- edit files at https://remix.ethereum.com/
